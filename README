NAME
    RPM::Spec - A very simplistic read-only method of accessing RPM spec
    files

SYNOPSIS
        use RPM::Spec;

        my $spec = RPM::Spec->new('path/to/my.spec');

        say 'Version is: ' . $spec->version;
        say 'Spec has an epoch' if $spec->has_epoch;

DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: This code is actively being worked on, and the API may change.

    RPM::Spec provides simplistic access to the different bits of
    information a spec file provides... It is basically a collection of
    different parsing routines that were scattered through a bunch of other
    modules.

CLASS FUNCTIONS
    new(specfile => [Str|File])
        Create a new RPM::Specfile object. The only required parameter is
        'specfile', which is either a string or Path::Class::File object
        pointing to the location of the specfile.

METHODS
  Tag Functions
    These methods each return the value of the given tag. If the tag is not
    present, undef is returned.

    license
    epoch
    release
    version
    source0
        Note this will pick up from either of "Source" or "Source0" tags.

    name
    url
    summary
    middle
        The "middle" of a spec; e.g. everything from the first %description
        until the changelog starts.

  Dependency Functions
    Documentation as this interface is likely to change in the Very Near
    Future.

  Content Functions
    content()
        Returns an array of strings representing the specfile.

    has_content
        Is the file empty?

    num_lines_in_content
        Returns the line count of the specfile.

    grep_content(sub { ... })
        Given a coderef, greps through the content with it. See also grep.

CAVEATS
  No macro parsing
    Macros are not evaluated. e.g., if "Release: 1%{?dist}" is in your spec
    file, "1%{?dist}" will be returned by release().

  Read only!
    We can't make any changes.
